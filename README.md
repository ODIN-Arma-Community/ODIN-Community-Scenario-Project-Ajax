 ## üìë About the Mode ‚ùì
"Project Ajax" is a highly determinated project that focuses dynamic, open-world game mode for Arma Reforger that combines mission variety, civilian interaction, and player-driven consequences.<br><br>


Players take on evolving objectives, build and operate from forward bases, and influence the world around them. It also included a civilian reputation which will change how the missions unfolds.<br>

Inspired by classics like Invade & Annex, COE2, Freedom Fighters, and Hearts and Minds, this mode is built to be community-driven, replayable, and shaped by your actions.<br>

## ***Please Note:** *This Mode in Heavily Work In Progress**
